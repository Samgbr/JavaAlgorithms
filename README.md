##### Algorithms using Java
+ Word Transformer: Accepts two words of the same length and starting from the first word it will transform in to another word
by doing a word permutation from the second word given. If the first word found in the dictionary (dict.txt), it will do permutation on the found word until 
it reaches the second word. 
+ Pattern Matching: Accepts pattern and string value to construct a string from the pattern and compare it with the actual string.
Example: pattern in the form of a's and b's as: "aabab" and the actual string: "catcatgocatgo". Then map the unique words to a and b that is, a=cat and b=go then compare.
